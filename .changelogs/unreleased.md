## New: GregGuns Coins and the Vending Machine

- **GregGuns Coin** (`gregguns:coin`), GregGuns' own currency, in five values like the pack's coins: 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10K (damage 0 to 4). One coin breaks into ten of the next lower value in a crafting grid; ten coins and programmed circuit 10 make one of the next higher value in any GT Assembler.
- **GregGuns trades in the pack's Vending Machine.** 178 trades with every module on: guns, akimbo pairs, melee tools, loaded magazines, rounds, grenades, gun parts and components, armor, special-slot gear, flight devices, armor parts, turret plates and a spawn egg for every NPC, the Attack Helicopter, Cyberdemon, Alien Bug and Dictator Dave included. All are priced in GregGuns Coins by tier. With the GregGuns quest line installed, each tier's trades open with that tier's intro quest. The trades are added in memory when the server starts; `config/vendingmachine/tradeDatabase.json` is not touched. New key `compat.vendingTrades` (default on).
