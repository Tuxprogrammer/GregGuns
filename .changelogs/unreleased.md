# Unreleased

Notes for the next release. Fold these into that release's changelog when it is cut.

## Module flag mismatch warning

- When a client joins a server whose `modules.*` flags differ from the client's own `config/gregguns.cfg`, the player now gets one chat line naming each module that differs, and the log gets one warning. Recipes and NEI follow the client's own config, so set the same values there and restart. Singleplayer is unaffected.
